# odin-connect-four
Re-creating the classic connect four game in the terminal for learning TDD
## Learning Outcome
This project is coded with the objective of learning RSpec and the fundamentals of TDD process. The project used different RSpec fundamentals such as stubs and doubles, and exposed me to the benefits of TDD in generating cleaner and more direct code. By dissecting the problem, the coding process is more focused and efficient.
## Challenge Faced
The key challenge faced was creating the winning condition algorithm (which checks if the last move made by the player wins the game) efficiently, which I overcame by only carrying out the required algorithm in the direction where the adjacent piece matches the player's last move.
